## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with the [Mobilization](https://dutonium.pagerduty.com/teams/1141) [team](https://github.com/orgs/PagerDuty/teams/im-mobilization) on all things related to helping customers mobilize when an incident is triggered.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Elixir and the inner workings of PagerDuty systems. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy watching [The ADAC NÃ¼rburgring Langstrecken-Serie](https://www.nuerburgring-langstrecken-serie.de/en/startseite/) with my family in the spare time I can find.
